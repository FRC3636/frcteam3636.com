                <p>
                    Generals Robotics, assigned the team number of “3636,” was
                    founded in 2011 as a way to promote STEM at Grant High
                    School. Generals Robotics is based out of Grant High School,
                    but membership is open to any driven high school-aged
                    student who resides within the Portland metropolitan area,
                    who does not attend an educational institution already
                    affiliated with another FIRST Robotics Competition team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All are welcome on Generals Robotics; experience in S.T.E.M.
                    is not a prerequisite for membership. During their time on
                    the team, Generals Robotics members acquire valuable life
                    skills and professional connections. Participation in FIRST
                    programs such as FRC opens a myriad of new pathways for
                    students, from securing internships and grants to building a
                    network of experienced mentors in the engineering industry.
